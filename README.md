<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A simple bot I made for recreational use. You can use it for moderation use or to just have fun with your friends. I'm still in the process of adding more commands. 


### Built With

APIs used:
* Tenor API
* Urban Dictionary API

### Getting Started

1. Invite the bot to your server here: [https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=819727709105160222&permissions=8&scope=bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=819727709105160222&permissions=8&scope=bot)

2. Choose a server you would like to add the bot to and authorize all permissions.

3. Congrats, you have now added the bot to your server!
